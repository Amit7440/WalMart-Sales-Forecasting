        "\n",
        "A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing issues in managing the inventory - to match the demand with respect to supply.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tYou are provided with the weekly sales data for their various outlets. Use statistical analysis, EDA, outlier analysis, and handle the missing values to come up with various insights that can give them a clear perspective on the following:\n",
        "a.\tIf the weekly sales are affected by the unemployment rate, if yes - which stores are suffering the most?\n",
        "b. \tIf the weekly sales show a seasonal trend, when and what could be the reason?\n",

        "## Data Pre-processing steps and inspiration\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Loading the Dataset: The initial step involves loading the dataset into the analysis environment, typically using libraries like Pandas in Python, ensuring accessibility for further examination.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Checking for Data Types: It is imperative to inspect the data types of each column to ensure consistency and appropriateness for subsequent analyses and operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Converting Date Column: When dealing with temporal data, such as dates, converting the date column from an object type to a date type facilitates time-based analyses and visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Handling Outliers: Identification and treatment of outliers are crucial to maintain data integrity. Outliers are assessed visually through plots or statistically using methods like z-scores or IQR (Interquartile Range), ensuring their handling aligns with the context and domain knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Correlation Analysis: Utilizing tools like heatmaps aids in understanding the interrelationships between various features within the dataset, providing insights into potential dependencies and guiding further exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Exploring Relationships: Beyond correlation analysis, exploring relationships between columns through visualizations and statistical methods unveils additional patterns and dependencies, enriching the understanding of the dataset's dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Time Series Analysis: Conducting time series analysis involves assessing stationarity through techniques like examining rolling mean and standard deviation, essential for ensuring the reliability of subsequent forecasting models.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Forecasting Models Selection: Employing forecasting model ARIMA entails a methodical approach based on the dataset's characteristics and the desired level of complexity, enabling accurate prediction of future trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "These pre-processing steps and methodologies lay a solid foundation for rigorous data analysis and forecasting, contributing to informed decision-making and actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Choosing the algorithm for the project\n",
        "\n",
        "I am employing ARIMA model to conduct forecast analysis on the provided dataset. These methods offer diverse perspectives for predicting future trends and patterns within the data. ARIMA integrates autoregressive, moving average, and differencing components to capture complex temporal dynamics. By leveraging these techniques, I aim to generate accurate forecasts that inform decision-making and strategic planning. The model facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's predictive capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation and reasons for choosing ARIMA MODEL\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of algorithm for forecast analysis was motivated by its distinct strengths and suitability for different aspects of the dataset.\n",
        "Stationarity: ARIMA works well with stationary data or can be made stationary through differencing.\n",
        "Autocorrelation: ARIMA captures autocorrelation with AR and MA components.\n",
        "Flexibility: ARIMA handles various patterns like trend and seasonality.\n",
        "Simple Structure: It's easier to interpret and implement compared to some other models.\n",
        "Forecasting Accuracy: ARIMA provides accurate forecasts for many real-world datasets.\n",
        "Diagnostic Tools: ARIMA models come with diagnostic tools such as residual analysis, ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots, which help assess the model's adequacy and identify any remaining patterns in the residuals.\n",
        "By employing ARIMA MODEL, I aim to leverage its complementary strengths to generate robust and accurate forecasts that inform decision-making processes effectively.\n",
